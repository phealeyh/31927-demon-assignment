Cell automata based on the famous computer recreations named 'demon'

This program will allow you to generate patterns based on cellular automaton. What you will have when you generate these patterns are a set of rules by
which it will generate it by (depending on the states of it's neighbours) and the end result will be a symmetrical pattern that forms throughout
the panel. The program is GUI-based so the use of forms will be prevelant. To run the program, download the zip and run the application exe in the root folder.
